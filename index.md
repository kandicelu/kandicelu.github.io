Hi! My name is Kandice Lu, and I am a senior mechanical engineering student at Cornell University. I plan to pursue a Master's of Engineering following my bachelor's degree and am seeking an engineering internship for this upcoming summer. I am interested in structural and thermofluid analysis and design, especially in aerospace applications, but am eager to gain learn more about all areas.

I currently serve as the full team lead and fabrication lead for the Cornell Steel Bridge student project team. This role has given me experience in structural analysis, design for manufacturing and assembly, project management, and collaboration skills. Additionally, I am an undergraduate researcher with the ZT Group, assisting in research on polymer-based thermal interface materials.

In my free time, I enjoy photography, puzzles, and playing Tetris.
