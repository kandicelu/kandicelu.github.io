Hi! My name is Kandice Lu, and I am a senior mechanical engineering student at Cornell University. I am continuing with a M.Eng in aerospace engineering at Cornell following my bachelor's degrees, and am seeking an internship for the summer of 2026. My interests are in structural and thermofluid modelling and analysis, especially in aerospace applications, but I am eager to learn more in all areas.

I currently serve as the full team lead and fabrication lead for the Cornell Steel Bridge student project team. This role has given me experience in structural analysis, design for manufacturing and assembly, project management, and collaboration skills. Additionally, I am an undergraduate researcher with the ZT Group, assisting in research on polymer-based thermal interface materials.

In my free time, I enjoy photography, puzzles, and playing Tetris.
