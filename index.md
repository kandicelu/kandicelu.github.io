## About Me
![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

Hi! My name is Kandice Lu, and I am senior mechanical engineering student at Cornell University. I am passionate in aerospace engineering technologies, but would love to learn more about other areas as well. I plan to pursue a Master's of Engineering following my bachelor's degree, and am seeking an engineering internship for this upcoming summer. I am interested in gaining experience with design, testing, and analysis areas, especially in structural or thermofluid systems. Above all, I would love to make an impact by contributing to the development of new technologies.

I am currently the full team lead and fabrication lead for the Cornell Steel Bridge student project team, which has provided me with a background in structural analysis and designing for manufacturing and assembly, as well as invaluable project management and collaboration skills. I am also an undergraduate researcher aiding the ZT Group in research into polymer-based thermal interface materials.
