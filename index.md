Hi! My name is Kandice Lu, and I am a senior mechanical engineering student at Cornell University. I am passionate about aerospace engineering technologies, but I am also eager to learn about other areas. I plan to pursue a Master's of Engineering following my bachelor's degree and am seeking an engineering internship for this upcoming summer. I am particularly interested in design, testing, and analysis, especially in structural or thermofluid systems. Above all, I hope to make an impact by contributing to the development of new technologies.

I currently serve as the full team lead and fabrication lead for the Cornell Steel Bridge student project team. This role has given me experience in structural analysis, design for manufacturing and assembly, project management, and collaboration skills. Additionally, I am an undergraduate researcher with the ZT Group, assisting in research on polymer-based thermal interface materials.

In my free time, I enjoy photography, and puzzles, and playing Tetris
