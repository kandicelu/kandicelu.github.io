I am part of Cornell Steel Bridge, a project team that designs and fabricates a 20 foot bridge from scratch for an annual competition, where our design's weight, construction time, and deflection under a 2500lb load are combined to produce a final "cost" that determines scoring. 

In last year's cycle, I drew upon insights from past successful designs to develop an initial X-truss concept that was selected as our base design for the year. I then optimized the geometry and section properties using finite element analysis in STAAD.Pro, through which I reduced our projected “cost” metric by over 15%. I additionally worked on modelling and analyzing the welded and bolted connections between bridge components to ensure appropriate factors of safety. 

As the team's fabrication lead, I created manufacturing drawings for individual pieces, coordinated and oversaw our machining operations to fabricate almost 300 parts in a record time of 10 days. I worked on the welding of many of those parts as well, and aided in the load testing of the finished bridge to evaluate it's expected performance.

Our 2025 results:
- Bridge weight: 216 lbs
- Construction time: 17 minutes
- Aggregate deflection: 0.97 in
- Awards: 🥇 1st in Lightness · 🥈 2nd in Stiffness · 🥈 2nd in Structural Economy
