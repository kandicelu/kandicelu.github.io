**Technical Skills:** Coding in C/C++, Circuit Building, CAD, Laser Cutting, 

The final project for my Mechatronics class consisted of designing, coding, and building a robot for a cube cobundle exec jekyll serve
llecting competition. The robot was programmed with an Arduino in C/C++ and need to be completely autonomous once started, which was accomplished through movement logic based on input from color sensors. Due to constraints on the base size of the robot, self-deploying foldable arms were designed and built using laser cut acrylic, rubber bands, and the creative repurposing of spare bolts and spacers to create a locking mechanism.
