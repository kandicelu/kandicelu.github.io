For a class project, we were tasked with designing and building a slow-flying glider from scratch with limited materials. Potential airfoils were analyzed with XLFRS to maximize flight time under expected conditions. I wrote a script in MATLAB to calculate stable configurations of wing, tail, and center of gravity locations given size constraints. The configuration with the largest static margin was designed in Fusion 360, and constructed from laser cut balsa and tissue paper. The final glider design placed 5th in our end of semester competition for longest flight time.
