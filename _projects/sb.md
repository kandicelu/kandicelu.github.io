I am part of Cornell Steel Bridge, a project team that designs and fabricates a 20 foot bridge from scratch for an annual competition, where designs are scored on weight, construction time, and deflection under a 2500lb load, which are combined to produce a final "cost". 

In last year's cycle, I drew upon previous successful bridges to create an initial x-truss design that was later chosen as our base design for the year. After the base design was chosen, I optimized the geometry and section properties based on finite element analysis results, through which I was able to decrease the projected final "cost" by over 15%. I also worked on modelling connections between bridge members in Fusion 360 and performing finite element analysis to ensure our designed connections had appropriate factors of safety. 

As the team's fabrication lead, I created manufacturing drawings for individual pieces, coordinated and oversaw our machining operations to fabricate almost 300 parts in a record time of 10 days. I worked on the welding of many of those parts as well, and aided in the load testing of the finished bridge to evaluate it's expected performance.

Our final bridge weighed 216lbs, was constructed in 17 minutes, and had an agreggate defelection of only 0.97 inches, winning our team 1st place in Lightness, and 2nd in both Stiffness and Structural Economy.
