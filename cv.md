#### Relevant Experience
- **[Cornell Steel Bridge Project Team] - Full Team Lead, Fabrication Lead**  
  [Sep, 2023] - [Present]  
  - Lead a team of 30 students to design and fabricate a 20 foot steel bridge to withstand a 2500lb load with minimal deflection in an annual competition
  - Optimize structural efficiency by analyzing varied geometries and section properties, improving projected costs from the initial design by 15%
  - Designed member connections in Fusion 360 assessed connection safety factors through finite element analysis to ensure structural integrity under expected loads
  - Assess structural performance by conducting load testing & collaborating with teammates to swiftly troubleshoot issues, resulting in significantly improved deflection of the bridge under expected loading
  - Create shop drawings and specify tolerances for bridge components, and follow drawings to personally fabricate over 200 bridge components
 
- **[ZT Group] - Undergraduate Researcher**  
  [May, 2025] - [Present]  
  - Developed and optimized procedures for fabricating potential polymer-based thermal interface material samples
  - Characterized thermal properties of polymer samples to inform experimental changes to subsequent samples
 
#### Coursework Projects
- **[Cube Collecting Robot]**:  
  *[Designed and programmed an autonomous cube-collecting robot within given size and budget constraints]*  
  - Designed and implemented foldable, self-deploying collection arms to maximize initial size constraints
  - Coded autonomous movement paths to avoid edges and effectively sweep playing board based on color sensor inputs 
  - Assembled circuit with motors, color sensors, servos, and Arduino board

- **[Glider Project]**:  
  *[Designed and built a slow flying balsa glider]*  
  - Modelled glider skeleton with CAD, performing calculations to find the wing, tail, and body geometry necessary for balanced flight
  - Constructed glider from scratch, using laser cut balsa components, tissue paper, and clay. 
  - Tested and rebalanced constructed glider as needed to achieve desired speed and stability, achieving 5th place in the final competition for longest flight time

- **[Reverse Engineering]**:  
  *[Deconstructed and reverse-engineered a door lock/and knob]*  
  - Documented and reported detailed disassembly and re-assembly steps 
  - Investigated mechanical workings of the lock to determine function of each component
  
#### Work Experience
- **[Finger Lakes Reuse] - Administrative Project Intern**  
  [June, 2025] - [Aug, 2025]  
  - Researched the viability of and assisted in the implementation of transitions to new report creation and price management systems
  - Assisted chief officers in creating and organizing various strategic documents, databases, and reports
